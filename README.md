Hello friends!

My name is Samir, and I like HTML and CSS. I am a gamer, so I like to play Destiny 2 and Overwatch!

Check [here](blubberyyew.github.io) for more posts on who I am!

I would like to give you a preview of one of my HTML projects that I have been working on. Of course, I will not display the image for copyright purposes.
